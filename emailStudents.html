	Information regarding your practicum placement for the upcoming semester is now available for you to view by logging into the DIARY system using the following URL. This is not a direct link so you will need to <strong>copy and paste</strong> it into your internet browser. Be sure you are using Mozilla Firefox as your browser!</p>
<p>
	<a href=\"\\\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">https</a><a href=\"\\\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">://msumapps.mnstate.edu/diary/</a><a href=\"\\\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">students</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Your cooperating teacher will expect to hear from you this week to make arrangements to begin your practicum. If possible, schedule in at least two hours for each visit in order to make the best use of time for both you and your cooperating teacher. You must complete 32 hours over a minimum of five weeks.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You may call or use email to contact your teacher initially to set up a time to meet. Do not leave a message asking him/her to return your call. You may want to call the school secretary and ask what would be the best time to reach your teacher. Please notify the Field Experience Office if you find out that we have the wrong grade level or any other critical information. We use information provided to us by teachers but sometimes there are changes that we do not have in our data.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You will be required to scan and upload the following three forms in DIARY during the semester. These are listed on your Deadline Checklist (handed out in class). Check for specific due dates. If time allows, you may finish your hours sooner than the specified end date and upload your forms earlier.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong><u>Schedule Information sheet:</u></strong> This form indicates that you&rsquo;ve discussed a schedule with your cooperating teacher and have begun working in the classroom (or will begin soon).</li>
	<li>
		<strong><u>Form A:</u></strong>&nbsp; This form verifies your hours of attendance up to approximately midterm.&nbsp;<em>Be sure to add up your hours and record the total before turning it in! Also, before handing Form A in, record those hours on the bottom of Form B</em></li>
	<li>
		<strong>&nbsp;<u>Form B:</u> </strong>This form notes the hours logged after midterm. The hours from Forms A&amp;B must equal at least 32 in order for you to pass ED205.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Remember&hellip;EACH OF THESE FORMS <strong><u>MUST</u></strong> BE SIGNED BY YOUR COOPERATING TEACHER BEFORE YOU UPLOAD THEM IN DIARY OR THEY WON&rsquo;T BE ACCEPTED!!</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><em><u>Please read the professionalism criteria below. You will be held accountable for this information.</u></em></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>You are expected to maintain confidentiality and data privacy laws.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>You are a guest in the cooperating teacher&#39;s classroom. Be respectful and thankful for the opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>If you have any concerns or questions during your practicum experience, please contact me. Dealing with an issue proactively is generally most effective. </strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Maintain appropriate boundaries with students, faculty and staff in the building where you are placed. </strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Appropriate professional dress and communication is expected.</strong></p>

	Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
	There are some updates in DIARY that I wanted to make you aware of.&nbsp; First, I will need you add or update your letter of introduction.&nbsp; If you have a letter currently in DIARY, and it is updated, you do not have to make changes, but in order for it to be current for the fall semester, you do need to log into DIARY and click on edit and then submit the letter.</p>
<p>
	Also, once you have the email verification of your insurance from EMSP, you will need to copy and paste that into a word document and save that to your desktop, then upload it in DIARY under liability insurance on your details page.&nbsp; There is an upload icon on the far right side of the insurance section.&nbsp; Click this and then browse for your verification document select and click the upload icon again.</p>
<p>
	Thanks so much for taking care of these two things as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Contact myself or Tracy Heng hengt@mnstate.edu&nbsp;&nbsp; with any questions.</p>
<p>
	Lisa Staiger</p>

                   <input type="hidden" name="emailBodyChoice[]" value='<p>

	Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
	Congratulations, on your readiness to student teach!&nbsp; This is an exciting stage in your preparation at MSUM.&nbsp; I am hard at work securing your student teaching placement(s) for the fall 2013 semester, and all is going well.&nbsp; There are several things that you will need to do, and to know about at this point.</p>
<p>
	First, it is time to go into DIARY and update (or add) your professional letter of introduction.&nbsp; This must be done as soon as possible since I will send information out to cooperating teachers shortly and they will view this letter as they decide whether to accept or decline your placement.&nbsp; Please add any current experiences to your letter and also at this point, add some detail about what you have been able to do and learn about in the field and/or in your coursework. It is important to edit carefully and to show enthusiasm about the upcoming experience.&nbsp; You should also check to see that you have upload an appropriate photograph of yourself.&nbsp; Remember this should reflect you as a professional educator and should feature only yourself.&nbsp; Please no other family members, friends or animals, etc. in the picture.</p>
<p>
	Second, there is a mandatory student teaching orientation meeting scheduled for<strong> May 7th from 4 - 5:30 PM in CMU 101.&nbsp;</strong> Everyone who plans to student teach in the fall 2013 semester is<strong> required to attend this meeting </strong>and I will verify and keep record of your attendance.&nbsp; I will address all the specifics of student teaching, including requirements and expectations. I will also answer any questions you may have at that time regarding student teaching or your placement.&nbsp; There will also be some important TPA information shared during the meeting as well.&nbsp; Please mark this day and time on your calendar now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Finally, we will talk about this at the meeting, however, you will be expected to both purchase insurance and to complete a background check in August, before you begin in your student teaching placement.&nbsp; You cannot do that at this time, but must wait until August to complete these.&nbsp; I just want it to be on your radar.</p>
<p>
	I look forward to seeing everyone on May 7th.&nbsp; Have a great last few weeks of the semester.</p>
<p>
